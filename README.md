# ArcanesAndWeapons-StoryTeller
This is a port of a table game (made by me) to smartphones using Angular + Capacitor JS. The ideia is to have two apps, one to control the player character attributes and cards, and another to be the master, which will tell the pre-written stories and should integrate with Groq AI to bring imersion to the game! Both should use the same stack!
